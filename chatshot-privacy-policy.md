Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

Permissions:
- storage: Used to save user preferences (such as export format and language settings) locally on the device.
- offscreen: Used to create an offscreen document for stitching screenshot images on a canvas.
- clipboardWrite: Used to copy the captured screenshot to your clipboard.
- alarms: Used to periodically refresh configuration data.
- downloads: Used to save screenshots as files when the user chooses to download instead of copying to clipboard.
- host_permissions (all_urls): Required because screenshot buttons are injected directly into web pages. Unlike extensions that activate from the toolbar, this extension needs to run content scripts on supported AI chat sites to inject and respond to in-page button clicks, and to capture the visible tab for screenshots.

The extension does not transmit any data to external servers. All captured screenshots are processed locally and copied to your clipboard or saved to your device. All settings remain local to the user's browser.
