Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

Permissions:
- activeTab: Used only to temporarily access the current page when the user activates the extension, so the extension can add an expand button to scrollable areas.
- storage: Used only to save and restore the user’s preferences (such as expansion mode) locally on the device.
- host permissions: Used only to allow the extension’s script to run on web pages in order to detect scrollable areas and insert the expand button.

The extension does not transmit any data to external servers. All settings remain local to the user’s browser.
